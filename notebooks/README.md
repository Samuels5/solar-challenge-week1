This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for the Solar Data Discovery Challenge â€“ Week 1. Each notebook is dedicated to a specific stage of the analysis:

- **benin_eda.ipynb**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning, and profiling for the Benin solar dataset.
- **sierraleone_eda.ipynb**: EDA, cleaning, and profiling for the Sierra Leone solar dataset.
- **togo_eda.ipynb**: EDA, cleaning, and profiling for the Togo solar dataset.
- **compare_countries.ipynb**: Cross-country comparison of cleaned datasets, including statistical analysis and visualization to identify key differences and similarities in solar potential across Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo.

Each EDA notebook includes:

- Data loading and summary statistics
- Missing value and outlier analysis
- Data cleaning and export of cleaned CSVs
- Visualizations (time series, distributions, correlations, etc.)
- Observations and next steps

The comparison notebook synthesizes findings from all countries to support actionable recommendations for solar investment.
